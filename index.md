# Pulsar clock corrections

These pages are meant to be a repository of clock corrections recording the differences between observatory clocks and time standards. Such corrections are necessary for precision pulsar timing but they cannot be predicted going forward. It is therefore necessary to obtain clock corrections covering the time span of your observations. It is the intent of this repository to be a central location to obtain up-to-date clock corrections for all commonly used pulsar telescopes.
