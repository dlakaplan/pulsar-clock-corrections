## CHIME

CHIME (null) clock corrections

CHIME records data directly against GPS time, and thus no clock
corrections are necessary. This file is a placeholder to make that
obvious.

Leading comments from clock file:

    # Chime references its data directly to GPS time and therefore
    # requires no clock corrections. This file exists to make that
    # explicit.
