Arecibo clock corrections (TEMPO2 converted version)

This file is automativally converted from the TEMPO-format Arecibo
clock corrections, which cover the observatory's full operational
history. Please see the Arecibo clock corrections for details.

The earliest clock corrections in this file predate GPS and are
actually referenced to NIST time directly. Clock corrections from
after 1995 are referenced to GPS. This file does not distinguish
between the two, claiming to be entirely referenced to NIST.
