GPS to UTC clock corrections (Corrected)

This file is constructed from BIPM published data and should be up-to-date.

The BIPM publishes two different corrections from GPS to UTC:
the first, C0, corrects from the GPS Combined Clock to UTC. The second,
C0', corrects from a timescale that takes advantage of the broadcast
GPS almanac data to track UTC more closely.

This file uses C0' data, that is, it is for GPS time standards that
take advantage of the almanac data to improve their time correction.
Unfortunately the BIPM only publishes these corrections going back
to 2011.

<anne.archibald@newcastle.ac.uk>. For more detailed questions
about the BIPM's published corrections, contact <tai@bipm.org>.
