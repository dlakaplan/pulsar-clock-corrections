## GB853

Green Bank 85-3 telescope

This is one telescope of a set of three built as a sort of
prototype interferometer for the VLA. It was operated as a pulsar
observing instrument for some time after its initial purpose was
satisfied.

This telescope is not currently operating and so updated clock
corrections should not be necessary. That said, this clock
correction file is pulled from the TEMPO repository and may not
cover the entire time that the telescope was operational.

If questions arise, contact Ryan S. Lynch <rlynch@nrao.edu>.
